doorstop-qt is a graphical user interface built upon Doorstop with additional features to make it easier to handle and overview the structure.

Doorstop is a requirement management tool where you create documents by linking items (e.g. sections).

The program concerns documentation of three different categories: requirements, tests, and products. Each of these categories has its own view and each item can be linked between each other.

This software was mainly developed at Lab.gruppen.
